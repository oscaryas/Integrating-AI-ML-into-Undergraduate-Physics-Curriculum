# AI & ML Physics Curriculum
## Overview

This curriculum introduces machine learning within the undergraduate physics setting. It begins with traditional methods such as linear and logistic regression and moves toward practical applications of these tools in physics. The aim is to balance coding practice with core ideas such as model capacity, overfitting and underfitting, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter sweeps. By focusing on these fundamentals, students gain both practical skills and a conceptual understanding of how machine learning can support physics research and education.

## Structure

The modules begin with GitHub basics to provide students with version control and workflow practice. This is followed by regression and classification methods, leading into an introduction to PyTorch as the main framework for implementation. Forward and backpropagation are introduced both mathematically and in code, and these ideas are then linked to applications such as leukemia detection. The structure is designed to give a clear and gradual path from basic ML methods to meaningful use cases in physics.

## Future Work

While the current modules provide a strong foundation, there are several ways for future students to expand this work. Possible directions include adding more unit tests for the implemented functions, writing a bug guide to support teaching assistants when students encounter errors, and creating less mathematically heavy explanations of forward and backpropagation. Future contributors may also curate a larger collection of datasets to support group projects and broaden the range of physics problems addressed.
